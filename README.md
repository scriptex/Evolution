# Evolution

A game based on the popular 2048 game

## Dev details

This game was built with Ionic 1 using AngularJS 1.6

**It is now outdated and unmaintained.**

A recode has been planed which will introduce modern framework/library along with most up-to-date coding techniques using ES2017.

## About

Everyone is familiar with the 1024 game. The 2048 is an extended version of the original one.

Evolution is almost the same :) The difference is the idea behind the progress: It follows the Darwin theory of evolution and allows you to start as an insect and evolve all the way up to a human.
